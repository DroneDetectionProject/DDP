# EwX: Decentralized Drone & Operator Detection

A public infrastructure for real-time RF triangulation and anti-drone defense — built with Web3 principles, token governance, and community-operated swarm hardware.

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The EwX system consists of:

- Lightweight (<1 kg) drone-mounted RF detectors
- Triangulation algorithms embedded in the firmware
- Decentralized telemetry logging on-chain (L2)
- DAO-based governance and EwX token utility
- Public, trustless signal verification via IPFS and blockchain

This architecture enables decentralized, survivable drone operator detection in real-time — under jamming, in active zones, and without central infrastructure.
