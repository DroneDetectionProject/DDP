# üõ∞Ô∏è EwX: Decentralized Drone & Operator Detection

**EwX** is an open-source radio-intelligence infrastructure designed to disrupt hostile drone warfare  
through lightweight RF-based detection and blockchain transparency.

## üì° What It Does

EwX enables:

- Detection and geolocation of drone operators based on RF signals
- Passive detection of fiber-controlled and stealth drones via reflection
- Mountable modules on lightweight drones (<1 kg)
- Preprocessing onboard and decentralized signal reporting

## üí† Powered by Web3

All signal events are:

- Stored on-chain via decentralized protocols
- Transparent, tamper-proof, and community-verifiable
- Governed by the EwX DAO and token ecosystem

## üîê Token

| Field      | Value                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Token name | EwX                         |
| Supply     | 250,000,000                 |
| Ticker     | EWX                         |
| Utility    | Governance, access, staking |

## üß† Vision

We believe drone warfare can be disrupted by making operator detection:

- Affordable
- Decentralized
- Impossible to ignore

A $60,000 ground RF detector is destroyed in minutes.  
Our $850 drone-mounted node survives, self-heals, and maps the battlefield from above.

## üìà Roadmap

- Hardware & lab testing ‚Äî Q2‚ÄìQ3 2025  
- Field trials & data calibration ‚Äî Q3‚ÄìQ4 2025  
- DAO integration & chip miniaturization ‚Äî Q4 2025 ‚Äì Q1 2026
