# KrakenSDR-Based RF Prototype

This subdirectory contains the base open-source SDR implementation from the KrakenSDR project (https://github.com/krakenrf/gr-krakensdr), licensed under GPLv3.

We plan to adapt and extend this software to fit EwX's needs:

- Porting components to drone-mounted systems
- Swarm communication support
- Compression for blockchain telemetry
- Autonomous triangulation logic

All changes made here will remain open and published under the same license.
