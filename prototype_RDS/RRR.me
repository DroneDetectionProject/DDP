Prototype: KrakenSDR-Based RF System

This subdirectory contains the initial base from the open-source KrakenSDR project, licensed under GNU GPL v3.

We use it as a technical foundation for early-stage development of the EwX decentralized RF detection network.
ðŸ§© Why KrakenSDR?

KrakenSDR is one of the most well-known open-source SDR-based direction-finding implementations.
It provides a strong starting point for:

    Multi-antenna RF capture
    Signal direction-of-arrival processing
    GNU Radio integration

ðŸ”§ EwX Modifications (Planned / In Progress)

We plan to adapt this codebase for the EwX system, including:

    Drone-mounted lightweight porting
    Integration with onboard triangulation logic
    RF event compression and hash generation
    Logging into decentralized Ethereum-based telemetry system
    Swarm coordination between multiple airborne nodes

ðŸ“œ License & Credits

This code is based on the original work by KrakenRF, under:

GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3.0)
